# SplitDecision
My First Game
Hello and welcome to the github for splitdecision, my first game.

The idea for this game is simple. There are a lot of games that involve moving your character in a path. 
Those games can easilly get repetitive and easy after a while. So why not have 2 of that going on at the same time?
By having 2 independent paths to follow, the user will soon find themself losing the game because they have focused on one
of the paths and forgotten about the other. So enjoy this game tear your head apart. :)
